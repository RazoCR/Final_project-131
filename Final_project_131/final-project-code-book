Final Project code book 

The dataset consist of the 32 columns with 569 instances/observations and none of the rows have any missing values.This data set has 31 predictor variables and 1 response variable which is diagnosis of the breast tissue.

id : ID number 

diagnosis : The diagnosis of breast tissues (M = malignant, B = benign)

radius_mean : mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter

texture_mean: standard deviation of gray scale values 

perimeter_mean : mean size of the core tume 

area_mean : calculations of mean 

smoothness_mean : mean of local variaiton in radius length 

compactness_mean : mean or perimeter^2/ area - 1.0

concavity_mean : mean of severity of concave portions of the contour 

concave_point : mean for number of concave portions of the contour 

symmetry_mean : mean of the scales 

fractal dimension : mean for "coast approximation"

radius_se : standard error for the mean of distances from center to point on the perimeter 

texture_se : standard error for standard deviation  of gray scale 

smoothness_se : standard error for local variation in radius lengths 

compactness_se: stadnard error for perimeter^2 

fractal_dimension : standard error for coast line approximation 

radius_worst : Worst valoe for mean of distances from center to points on perimeter 

texture_worst : worst value for stand value of grey scale value 

smoothness_worst : local variaitons in radius length 

compactness_worst : largest mean value 

fractal_demnsion : largest value of coastline approximation 


dt : reading in full data 

train : we splitted 80% of data to be in the training set 

test : 20% of the data will lie in the testing set.
